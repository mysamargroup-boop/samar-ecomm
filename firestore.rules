/**
 * Core Philosophy: This ruleset implements a dual security model tailored for an e-commerce application.
 * It provides public, read-only access to catalog data (products, categories) while enforcing
 * strict, role-based administrative control over writes to that data. For user-specific information
 * (customer profiles, orders), it employs a strict ownership model, ensuring users can only
 * access their own data.
 *
 * Data Structure:
 * - /products/{productId}: Publicly readable product catalog.
 * - /categories/{categoryId}: Publicly readable product categories.
 * - /customers/{customerId}: Private user data, where {customerId} is the user's UID.
 * - /customers/{customerId}/orders/{orderId}: A user's private order history, nested for ownership.
 * - /roles_samar/{uid}: A lookup collection to grant samar privileges. A user is an samar if a
 *   document exists with their UID as the ID.
 *
 * Key Security Decisions:
 * - Samar Role Management: The /roles_samar collection is used for authorization checks. To prevent
 *   privilege escalation, all client-side writes to this collection are disabled. Samar roles must
 *   be managed through a trusted backend server or the Firebase Console.
 * - User Data Privacy: Listing all customers is explicitly forbidden to protect user privacy. Users
 *   can only fetch their own /customers/{customerId} document.
 * - Catalog Management: Anyone can view products and categories, but only users designated as
 *   samars in the /roles_samar collection can create, modify, or delete them.
 * - Default Posture: The default security posture is to deny access. Rules explicitly grant
 *   permissions based on the defined roles and ownership structures.
 *
 * Denormalization for Authorization:
 * This ruleset uses an existence-based check against the `/roles_samar/{uid}` collection to determine
 * if a user has administrative privileges. This avoids embedding roles in custom tokens and allows
 * for dynamic role management without re-authenticating the user. It is a highly performant
 * and secure pattern for role-based access control.
 *
 * Structural Segregation:
 * The ruleset leverages separate top-level collections for public data (/products, /categories)
 * and private, user-owned data (/customers). This segregation simplifies the rules, enhances
 * query performance, and provides a strong security boundary between public and private information.
